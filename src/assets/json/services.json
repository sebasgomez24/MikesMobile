A cement chimney crown that is properly designed to overhang the outside dimensions of the chimney structure is the best solution. When your chimney crown becomes cracked or has lost pieces of its original shape it no longer is doing the job that it needs to. Once your chimney crown begins deteriorating and falling apart, it won’t be long before serious damage will set in to your entire chimney. It may be worth a visit to your roof once in a while to do your own inspection of the chimney crown. Don’t take our word for it – just take a quick drive around downtown and look up at the older masonry chimneys. Most of them are literally falling apart from the top down. The last thing someone needs is bricks falling down or costly repairs. When we service our customers with their annual inspection and chimney cleaning, the chimney crown is a key area that we look at. If there are any defects at all, we suggest an immediate crown seal to prevent more damage."

Any time our technicians examine your chimney during an inspection we look closely at the condition of the chimney liner. The liner moves all the gases and smoke out of your home and allows extremely hot and toxic gases to exit your home safely. Any breaks or openings in the chimney liner can lead to serious problems, potentially allowing a spark or floating ember to escape into the area between the lining and the chimney. The chimney needs a non-combustible lining that allows complete and efficient venting of the smoke, gases and particulate matter that drafts out of your chimney. Chimney liners can be made of many materials like clay tiles, cast masonry mix, aluminum or stainless steel. Any small cracks, breeches or deterioration can affect the way your entire system performs. If gases or combustible materials escape into attics, walls or ceiling spaces that are next to the chimney a fire may start or smolder causing damage and life-threatening conditions."

                "description":"If your chimney is not pulling smoke up and out of your home, you may have problems with the chimney lining. Smelly fireplaces can also mean that your creosote and soot is building up quickly and may indicate other problems with chimney liners. The inside of your chimney needs to be cleaned regularly and a qualified chimney sweep may see potential chimney lining problems during routine cleaning. Sulfur in smoke when mixed with moisture can cause a corrosive reaction and eat small holes in metal liners over time. Clay tile liners always deteriorate and develop cracks that open up the chimney to moisture and will eventually create structural problems that require expensive repairs or even rebuilding. If you see pieces or chips of your clay tiles in your firebox, you can be sure that you need to have your liner inspected for serious defects. Any time that a customer converts to a new type of heating system, installs a new wood stove, fireplace insert or other heating appliance they need to make sure that the chimney liner matches the output requirements of the new system. Wind, snow and rain combined with freeze and thaw cycles can take a toll on your chimney. Make sure things are buttoned up and tight when it comes to your chimney lining on the inside, and you will have much longer life of the chimney structure on the outside. The number one reason for chimney fires is because of a faulty chimney liner. Actually many older homes had chimneys built with no chimney liner at all! There are ways to upgrade these historic homes by adding chimney liners that will add years to the life of the chimney and make for a much safer operation. Today the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) requires in their code that all masonry chimneys have a liner."

Pre Fab or Zero Clearance Fireplaces (ZC’s) are different from masonry fireplaces in that they are not made of brick and mortar. Instead, ZC’s are made out of very thin sheet metal and refractory cement panels. ZC’s get their name for two simple reasons; “Pre Fab” because they are a sheet metal fireplace “pre-fabricated” in a factory. “Zero Clearance” because there’s very little “clearance” between the flammable 2X4 wood framing of your home and the metal box. Often flammable 2X4’s are located within ½ inch of the sheet metal! If you were to light a fire in this box with damaged or missing refractory panels, two things could happen. First, the metal could get really hot and warp, thus permanently damaging the fireplace itself. Secondly, and worst of all, as the metal got hot, you chance having the heat transfer onto the nearby flammable 2X4 studs, thus catching the house on fire! To keep this from happening, the Pre Fab Fireplaces have refractory cement insulating panels in the box which keep the metal cooler. Like any other household appliance, with use, these panels eventually wear out and need to be replaced. Radiant Firebacks can significantly increase the lifespan of your refractory panels and at the same time make your fireplace more efficient."

Also, if no cracks are visible, but chunks of the cement have fallen off (spalling) picture, it should be replaced, as well. Continued fires with damaged panels is risky business, so don’t risk it! If your panels need replacement, do not continue to burn fires until damaged panels have been replaced by a qualified professional."

Once we have found evidence of chimney glazing we will leave you with the proper chemicals needed to begin the de-glazing process. After an application of this chemical, we have you burn while using this for the next 1-2 weeks before we return to sweep out the broken-down glaze. Any remaining glaze will be attended to with either chemical or physical agitation with some requiring both. Once the chimney de-glazing process is complete we will instruct you on the probable cause of the glaze and further prevention."

Most people don’t know their dryer vents need to be cleaned. They clean out their lint filter now and then and think that’s it. But the dryer vent duct is where lint can really build up and get clogged. Lint is highly flammable, accounting for most dryer vent fires. In addition to lint buildup, improper installation of your dryer vent system can also pose a serious danger to you. Our dryer vent cleaning professionals will detect potential hazards such as the presence of flammable vinyl duct or a duct run that is improperly routed. So ensure your family’s safety with a professional inspection."

A dryer vent clogged with lint reduces airflow so your dryer doesn’t dry as efficiently as it used to. An inefficient dryer also uses more energy, thereby costing you more money."

A professional can also service all venting situations, including today’s extremely long vent ducts in contemporary construction. These ducts are especially susceptible to lint buildup. So don’t take a chance – put your family’s safety in the hands of a professional. It will protect them against potential fire and save you money as well – two great reasons why you should think about your dryer vent."
