Many areas that are concealed from visual examination may need to be opened up by removing bricks, masonry, metal flue pipes, interior chimney walls, chimney crowns or other components of your system. These chimney inspections are only required when the earlier chimney inspection Level 1 or 2 reveals a serious problem and we need to gain access to the problem areas hidden from view. Level 3 chimney inspections are needed on less than 2% of all chimney inspections when serious problems are suspected that require immediate action.",
